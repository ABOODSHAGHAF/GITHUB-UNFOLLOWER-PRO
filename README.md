# üöÄ GitHub Unfollower Pro

> **‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT:**
> 
> Your GitHub Personal Access Token **MUST** have the `user:follow` scope enabled for unfollow/follow actions to work. If you do not check this scope when creating your token, the tool will not be able to unfollow or follow users, and you may see 404 errors from the API. See the [GitHub Token Configuration](#-github-token-configuration) section below for details.

A powerful, professional web application for intelligent GitHub following management. Built with advanced analytics, safety features, and a modern UI to help you optimize your GitHub networking strategy.

## üö® Important Limitations

### **GitHub API Restrictions**
- **5,000 requests per hour** for authenticated users
- **Rate limiting** automatically enforced by the tool
- **Token permissions** must include `user:follow` scope

### **Recommended Usage**
- **Daily operations**: Limit to 100-200 unfollows per day
- **Bulk operations**: Use selective unfollowing for large lists
- **API conservation**: Avoid unnecessary repeated analyses

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues**

**‚ùå "API rate limit exceeded"**
```
Solution: Wait 1 hour or use selective unfollowing with smaller batches
```

**‚ùå "Authentication failed"**
```
Solution: Verify your GitHub token has correct permissions and hasn't expired
```

**‚ùå "User not found"**
```
Solution: Some users may have been deleted or changed usernames
```

**‚ùå "Connection timeout"**
```
Solution: Check internet connection and GitHub API status
```

## üÜï Accessibility & UI Improvements

- The warning box for critical actions (like unfollow) is now styled for **high visibility** in both light and dark themes, using a high-contrast yellow background and dark text.
- All important warnings and confirmations are easy to read regardless of your system or browser theme.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Username Handling

- **Usernames are now case-sensitive for API calls.**
- The tool uses the exact username as returned by the GitHub API when performing follow/unfollow actions.
- If you see 404 errors for users you are sure you are following, double-check your token scope and that the username matches exactly (including case).

## üßë‚Äçüíª Troubleshooting & FAQ

### **Q: I get 404 errors when trying to unfollow users I am following.**
- **A:** Make sure your GitHub token has the `user:follow` scope enabled. This is required for follow/unfollow actions. Also, ensure you are using the exact username as returned by the API (case-sensitive).

### **Q: I don't see the "Follow" button after unfollowing someone.**
- **A:** GitHub's UI may cache your follow status for a few minutes. Try refreshing the page, using an incognito window, or waiting a few minutes. If you or the other user has blocked each other, the button will not appear.

### **Q: The warning box is hard to read in dark mode.**
- **A:** The UI now uses a high-contrast yellow background and dark text for all warnings, making them visible in both light and dark themes.

### **Q: Why do I see only "Block or Report" on a user's profile?**
- **A:** This means you are not following the user, and either you have blocked them, they have blocked you, or GitHub's UI is still updating. Check your block list and try again later.

### **Q: How can I confirm if a user was unfollowed?**
- **A:** Check your following list on GitHub (https://github.com/your-username?tab=following) and search for the username. If they do not appear, you are not following them.
